# Pursuit-Core-iOS-Firestore-Lab

Continue the app from [here](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-iOS-Firestore-Demo) and add the following functionality:

- In the PostsViewController, implement a custom cell that also shows information about the user that submitted the post
- Add a "date" field to the post and sort the posts by the submitted date
- Selecting a post should segue to a Detail View Controller where the user can see all comments from a post, and add a comment to the post
